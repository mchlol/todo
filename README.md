# to do list

Time to tackle the ol' to do list app. 
Using webpack, bootstrap, and sass.  

## UI

Pretty shameless based on Todoist (which I actually use already!) but what I noticed about the other apps suggested is that...they all look pretty much the same. I'll be using sass for the css and also trying out Bootstrap.  

**Note:** work out a way to automate compiling the sass and the build process together, I don't want all my css in a style tag in the head.  
[something like this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50394789/webpack-4-compile-scss-to-separate-css-file)  

## Steps for the javascript

create a text input and button  
create a div to act as a view pane  
clicking the button creates an object  
make a class to create the todo objects from  
each todo object contains the string from the text input as 'title'  
along with 'description' 'dueDate' and 'priority'
